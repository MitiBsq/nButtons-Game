# nButtons-Game
Second Project

This is my second project where im testing my beginner javascript knowledge with a little bit of css and of course html5

It's a game where you select the difficulty by choosing the number of buttons you want to play with, of course higher the number lower the chances.
This is a more advanced structure than the most recent project, evolving step by step.
